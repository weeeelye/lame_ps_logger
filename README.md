# lame_ps_logger

1) Contains a lame ass PS key logger script. Virus total 0% detections.

2) A C++ program from https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger. Some antivirus looks for the keyword "Keyboard". Simply removing those words and recompiling evades the AVs. Only 3 obscure AVs detects it. Project1.exe is simply the compiled version of that source code
